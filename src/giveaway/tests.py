I know what it's like to feel worthless, unwanted or too weak to even cry, but I was lucky to have close friends standing by me, and most importantly, my family, whom I could rely on. Still I know that many people don't have such a gift: many have separated from their loved ones, leaving them far away, while others didn't have it anyway. And that's why I want to help others who may be going through the same thing that I've been through and am going through.

I want to help students who feel out of place or disconnected from the university community to gain a sense of belonging to it. I truly believe that the university does a lot to maintain the emotional and mental well-being of students, and I would like to participate in these efforts. For me, the CA program is like one of those helping hands and I hope to contribute to this.

Self-reflection is my secret weapon, to understand what's really going on inside me is a great ability. It helps me calm down, see the real inside of problems and focus on moving forward, instead of blaming myself or others, exhausting myself more and more. I realized that acceptance and understanding often bring more healing than anything else.

The main thing here is to love yourself and give yourself time. Any effort is commendable, the thing is not to blame yourself, but to move and love yourself for attempts, even if they are unsuccessful.

Participating in the CA program means more to me than just being part of a teamâ€”it's an opportunity to remind others that they're not alone, no matter what they have to go through.'''))
